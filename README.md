#Bachelor thesis
This  work  is  devoted  to  the  development  of  an  information  system  for  pattern recognition.  Methods  for  developing  applications  on  OpenCV  technology  in  the programming language Python are discussed in detail. Based on the features of the language described in the work, the application itself is developed on this platform and  a  new  cascade  is  generated  for  further  use.  Detailed  methods  for  recognizing faces when developing an application are described.Main goals:As an example, based on the OpenCV library in a virtual environment, demonstrate the cascade workout and develop an appropriate algorithm for the application. This paper considers three main tasks:
- Development of an algorithm for recognizing faces
- Development of an algorithm for object recognition
- Training of the cascade for further use in the form of an .xml document
